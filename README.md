# HashTable

This program is an implementation of a hash map in Python using a hash table of buckets, each containing a linked list of hash links. A dynamic array is used to store hash table. 
Each hash link stores the key-value pair (string and object in this case) and a pointer to the next link in the list. The key / value pairs are implemented using singly linked list.
